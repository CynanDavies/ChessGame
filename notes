Square notation:

5 bit:

0 - 2 Piece_type (0 Empty, 1 Pawn, 2 Knight, 3 Bishop, 4 Rook, 5 Queen, 6 King, 7 Inaccessible)
3 Has moved flag
4 colour

Efficiency of move calculation:
The recursive move calculation takes far longer, than the knight and pawn move calculation
Maybe I can do something about that?

Note: Iterating through 10 x 12 board will take a lot longer. Maybe having two seperate boards
would make things quicker? Or maybe I can do something else?
